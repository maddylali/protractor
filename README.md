### Question 1
An API endpoint has been called which returns a JSON in the following format:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "id": "8B4FBA5D-7D8C-4574-923E-3702BF482AA2",
        "first_name": "Foo",
        "last_name": "Bar",
        "email": "foobar@abc.com",
        "is_suspended": false
      },
      {
        "id": "1EBBD21B-8AB9-4BFC-A443-C35C7B9ABBA3",
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "Appleseed",
        "email": "john@abc.com",
        "is_suspended": false
      },
      {
        "id": "AC8C3C74-5FF8-4401-AEB3-5DF2B7BFB9F2",
        "first_name": "Lorum",
        "last_name": "Ipsum",
        "email": "lorum@abc.com",
        "is_suspended": false
      },
      {
        "id": "9CF271EB-7277-4F7E-AD15-664904047456",
        "first_name": "Test",
        "last_name": "User",
        "email": "test@abc.com",
        "is_suspended": true
      }
    ]
  },
  "status": "success",
  "message": null
}
```

This response been parsed into a global variable known as ```usersResponse``` and can be used accordingly.

For this question, iterate over the ```usersResponse``` and display each with the following headers (e.g. table, et cetera).

```
Email
First Name
Last Name
Is Suspended?
```

### Question 2
On the page where users have been iterated, add a ```Create``` button.

This button should trigger a modal that displays the following fields within a form:

```
Email
First Name
Last Name
Password
Confirm Password
```

There should also be a ```hidden``` input field named ```id``` that has a random UUID4. If unfamiliar, generate UUIDs [here](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/).

Finally, add a ```Submit``` and ```Cancel``` button.

#### Submit button
This button should validate the following requirements:

```
E-mail: required, e-mail format (@)
First Name: required
Last Name: required
Password: required
Confirm Password: required, matches with password
Identifier: required, UUIDv4
```

If failing to meet an above requirement, display an alert to the user.

If requirements are met, close the modal and superficially update the users list.

#### Cancel button
Closes the modal.

### Question 3
Add an edit button or icon to each row of iterated users (see Question #1).

Upon clicking this button, display the creation form (see Question #2) with prefilled user information.

TIP: Utilize the identifier (id) of the user to streamline these clickable URLs.

### Question 4
Utilizing a CSS style, apply an indicator (e.g. red text or red row background) when a user is suspended.
